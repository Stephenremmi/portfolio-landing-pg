    <h2 class="Background">Background</h2>
    <p>I was born 2001 in Huruma slums in a God-fearing family of 4 kids.My parents laid a firm foundation in our Christian faith and we are all born again Christians.
      i discovered my talent at a very young age while still in the slums, since we had a football pitch behind our home and every evening the entire neighbourhood would come to the field to play.
      During 2007 post election violence
       we were forced to move to a new enviroment;South C due to the insecurities in Eastlands at that time.
       I studied at Bellevue Primary School for 8 years and in between that period i played for Ligi Ndogo Academy and Elite FC.
       I was later called at Upperhill School to do my high school learning,which i recently finished successfully.I now reside at Ngong and i play for Vapour Ministries.
<h2 class="Hobbies">Hobbies</h2>
During free time, i do a lot of researching on updates in various fields such as IT ,sports, games and new releases in the Entertainment world.
I also do a lot of chatting in todays social platforms and watching of series,documentaries, and reality Tv shows on a regular.
You might be wondering how i keep myself physically fit by eating,watching and sleeping regularly but what you don't know is that football is blood,flesh and bone;
It's my God-given talent and i play football<strong>a lot</strong>
